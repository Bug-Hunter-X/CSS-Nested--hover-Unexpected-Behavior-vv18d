The following CSS code snippet demonstrates an issue where the expected behavior of the `:hover` pseudo-class is not achieved when nested inside another `:hover` pseudo-class.

```css
.outer {
  width: 100px;
  height: 100px;
  background-color: lightblue;
}

.outer:hover .inner {
  background-color: lightgreen;
}

.outer:hover:hover .inner {
  background-color: yellow;
}

.inner {
  width: 50px;
  height: 50px;
  background-color: lightcoral;
}
```

The `yellow` background color is expected to appear when the `.outer` element is hovered. However, the nested `:hover` is redundant and doesn't affect the behavior; only the `lightgreen` background color appears.
